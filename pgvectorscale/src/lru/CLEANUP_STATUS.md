# Code Cleanup Complete

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up all unused code and resolved all compiler warnings in the shared memory LRU implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. `pg_lru.rs`
- **Removed** unused `mark_for_deletion()` method (line 165)
- **Removed** unused `ptr_to_offset()` method (line 242)

### 2. `util/lru.rs`
- **Added** `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes to fields and methods that are only used in test mode:
  - CacheStats fields: `inserts`, `updates`, `hits`, `misses`, `evictions`
  - LruCacheWithStats fields: `cache_name`, `stats`
  - Methods: `new()`, `cap()`, `len()`, `contains()`, `push()`, `get()`, `stats()`, `stats_clone()`, `into_parts()`
- These are used conditionally based on compilation mode (test vs. production)

### 3. `cross_process_test.rs`
- **Removed** unnecessary `unsafe` block in `pgvs_shared_lru_stats()` function
- The `stats()` method is safe and doesn't require unsafe

## Build Status
✅ **All warnings resolved**
✅ **Code compiles cleanly**
✅ **No errors or warnings in cargo check**
✅ **No errors or warnings in cargo build**

## Code Quality Improvements
- Removed dead code that was never used
- Properly annotated conditionally-compiled code
- Reduced unnecessary unsafe blocks
- Maintained all functionality while cleaning up warnings

## Next Steps
The code is now clean and ready for:
- Integration testing with actual workloads
- Performance benchmarking
- Production deployment

pgvectorscale complements [pgvector][pgvector], the open-source vector data extension for PostgreSQL, and introduces the following key innovations for pgvector data:
- A new index type called StreamingDiskANN, inspired by the [DiskANN](https://github.com/microsoft/DiskANN) algorithm, based on research from Microsoft.
- Statistical Binary Quantization: developed by Timescale researchers, This compression method improves on standard Binary Quantization.

On a benchmark dataset of 50 million Cohere embeddings with 768 dimensions
each, PostgreSQL with `pgvector` and `pgvectorscale` achieves **28x lower p95
latency** and **16x higher query throughput** compared to Pinecone's storage
optimized (s1) index for approximate nearest neighbor queries at 99% recall,
all at 75% less cost when self-hosted on AWS EC2.

To learn more about the performance impact of pgvectorscale, and details about benchmark methodology and results, see the [pgvector vs Pinecone comparison blog post](http://www.timescale.com/blog/pgvector-vs-pinecone).

In contrast to pgvector, which is written in C, pgvectorscale is developed in [Rust][rust-language] using the [PGRX framework](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx),
offering the PostgreSQL community a new avenue for contributing to vector support.

**Application developers or DBAs** can use pgvectorscale with their PostgreSQL databases.
   * [Install pgvectorscale](#installation)
   * [Get started using pgvectorscale](#get-started-with-pgvectorscale)

If you **want to contribute** to this extension, see how to [build pgvectorscale from source in a developer environment](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

For production vector workloads, get **private beta access to vector-optimized databases** with pgvector and pgvectorscale on Timescale. [Sign up here for priority access](https://timescale.typeform.com/to/H7lQ10eQ).

## Installation

The fastest ways to run PostgreSQL with pgvectorscale are:

* [Using a pre-built Docker container](#using-a-pre-built-docker-container)
* [Installing from source](#installing-from-source)
* [Enable pgvectorscale in a Timescale Cloud service](#enable-pgai-in-a-timescale-cloud-service)

### Using a pre-built Docker container

1.  [Run the TimescaleDB Docker image](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/install/installation-docker/).

1. Connect to your database:
   ```bash
   psql -d "postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database-name>"
   ```

1. Create the pgvectorscale extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vectorscale CASCADE;
    ```

   The `CASCADE` automatically installs `pgvector`.

### Installing from source

You can install pgvectorscale from source and install it in an existing PostgreSQL server

1. Compile and install the extension

    ```bash
    # install prerequisites
    ## rust
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ## pgrx
    cargo install --locked cargo-pgrx
    cargo pgrx init --pg17 pg_config

    #download, build and install pgvectorscale
    cd /tmp
    git clone --branch <version> https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale
    cd pgvectorscale/pgvectorscale
    cargo pgrx install --release
    ```

    You can also take a look at our [documentation for extension developers](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for more complete instructions.

1. Connect to your database:
   ```bash
   psql -d "postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database-name>"
   ```

1. Ensure the pgvector extension is available:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name = 'vector';
   ```

   If pgvector is not available, install it using the [pgvector installation
   instructions][pgvector-install].


1. Create the pgvectorscale extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vectorscale CASCADE;
    ```

   The `CASCADE` automatically installs `pgvector`.

### Enable pgvectorscale in a Timescale Cloud service

Note: the instructions below are for Timescale's standard compute instance. For production vector workloads, we’re offering **private beta access to vector-optimized databases** with pgvector and pgvectorscale on Timescale. [Sign up here for priority access](https://timescale.typeform.com/to/H7lQ10eQ).

To enable pgvectorscale:

1. Create a new [Timescale Service](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?utm_campaign=vectorlaunch).

   If you want to use an existing service, pgvectorscale is added as an available extension on the first maintenance window
   after the pgvectorscale release date.

1. Connect to your Timescale service:
   ```bash
   psql -d "postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database-name>"
   ```

1. Create the pgvectorscale extension:

    ```postgresql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vectorscale CASCADE;
    ```

   The `CASCADE` automatically installs `pgvector`.


## Get started with pgvectorscale


1. Create a table with an embedding column. For example:

    ```postgresql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS document_embedding  (
        id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
        metadata JSONB,
        contents TEXT,
        embedding VECTOR(1536)
    )
    ```

1. Populate the table.

   For more information, see the [pgvector instructions](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/README.md#storing) and [list of clients](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/README.md#languages).
1. Create a StreamingDiskANN index on the embedding column:
    ```postgresql
    CREATE INDEX document_embedding_idx ON document_embedding
    USING diskann (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
    ```
1. Find the 10 closest embeddings using the index.

    ```postgresql
    SELECT *
    FROM document_embedding
    ORDER BY embedding <=> $1
    LIMIT 10
    ```

    Note: pgvectorscale currently supports: cosine distance (`<=>`) queries, for indices created with `vector_cosine_ops`; and L2 distance (`<->`) queries, for indices created with `vector_l2_ops`.  This is the same syntax used by `pgvector`.  If you would like additional distance types,
    [create an issue](https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale/issues).

## Tuning

The StreamingDiskANN index comes with **smart defaults** but also the ability to customize its behavior. There are two types of parameters: index build-time parameters that are specified when an index is created and query-time parameters that can be tuned when querying an index.

We suggest setting the index build-time paramers for major changes to index operations while query-time parameters can be used to tune the accuracy/performance tradeoff for individual queries.

 We expect most people to tune the query-time parameters (if any) and leave the index build time parameters set to default.

### StreamingDiskANN index build-time parameters

These parameters can be set when an index is created.

| Parameter name   | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Default value |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `storage_layout` | `memory_optimized` which uses SBQ to compress vector data or `plain` which stores data uncompressed | memory_optimized
| `num_neighbors`    | Sets the maximum number of neighbors per node. Higher values increase accuracy but make the graph traversal slower.                                           | 50            |
| `search_list_size` | This is the S parameter used in the greedy search algorithm used during construction. Higher values improve graph quality at the cost of slower index builds. | 100           |
| `max_alpha`        | Is the alpha parameter in the algorithm. Higher values improve graph quality at the cost of slower index builds.                                              | 1.2           |
| `num_dimensions` | The number of dimensions to index. By default, all dimensions are indexed. But you can also index less dimensions to make use of [Matryoshka embeddings](https://huggingface.co/blog/matryoshka) | 0 (all dimensions)
| `num_bits_per_dimension` | Number of bits used to encode each dimension when using SBQ | 2 for less than 900 dimensions, 1 otherwise

An example of how to set the `num_neighbors` parameter is:

```sql
CREATE INDEX document_embedding_idx ON document_embedding
USING diskann (embedding) WITH(num_neighbors=50);
```

#### StreamingDiskANN query-time parameters

You can also set two parameters to control the accuracy vs. query speed trade-off at query time. We suggest adjusting `diskann.query_rescore` to fine-tune accuracy.

| Parameter name   | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Default value |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `diskann.query_search_list_size` | The number of additional candidates considered during the graph search. | 100
| `diskann.query_rescore` | The number of elements rescored (0 to disable rescoring) | 50


You can set the value by using `SET` before executing a query. For example:

```sql
SET diskann.query_rescore = 400;
```

Note the [SET command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set.html) applies to the entire session (database connection) from the point of execution. You can use a transaction-local variant using `LOCAL` which will
be reset after the end of the transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL diskann.query_search_list_size= 10;
SELECT * FROM document_embedding ORDER BY embedding <=> $1 LIMIT 10
COMMIT;
```
